While the wait was longer than expected, I understand they were prioritizing more urgent cases. The doctor was thorough and didn't rush through my examination.  \n",

The nurse was nice though and brought me an extra blanket. The discharge instructions were confusing and I left not fully understanding my care plan.  "
